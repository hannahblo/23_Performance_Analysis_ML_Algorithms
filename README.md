#  R Code corresponding to the ISIPTA Project "Depth Functions for Partial Orders with a Descriptive Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithm"

This repository consits of R-Code corresponding the ISIPTA Project "Depth Functions for Partial Orders with a Descriptive Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithm". Here we analyze ML algorithms based on depth functions and give an counterexample to prove Property (P1) of
